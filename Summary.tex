\required{Project Summary}

\paragraph{Overview} 

The ability of organisms to adapt to new and changing conditions is vital in today's world of climate and other anthropogenic changes. Understanding and predicting this ability to adapt for species is thus key, and is especially relevant in crop species that are needed to sustain food and fuel sources for the world's growing populations. This research project aims to examine the genetic architecture of important traits for adaptation in maize before and after its domestication bottleneck. Two major questions will be addressed: 1) what is the distribution of effect sizes for mutations % reword? mutations don't underly the trait, loci do
underlying important phenotypic traits in maize and teosinte and 2) how do different histories of demography and selection change this genetic architecture over time and impact the species ability to adapt? Vast resources of genomic and phenotypic data in both teosinte and maize provide the ideal system in which to investigate these questions. I propose three objectives to answer these questions that make use of genomic and phenotypic data in both teosinte and maize as well as simulation methods to inform theoretical predictions in the system. The first objective is to estimate the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations in teosinte, maize's progenitor. From this result, simulations in objective two will be parameterized and run to simulate % used simulate twice in same sentence, fix
the demographic and selective history of maize during its domestication. This creates an expectation for how the genetic architecture of traits in maize, hypothesized to be either under selection during the domestication event or not, should change given its past and can be compared to real data to see if predictions match reality. Objective three then performs further simulations of additional demographic and selective events that varying landraces of maize have experienced to assess if further changes to genetic architecture are detected. This research will be conducted at the University of California, Davis, under the supervision of Dr. Jeffrey Ross\--Ibarra and cosupervised by Dr. Kevin Thornton at the University of California, Irvine.


\paragraph{Intellectual Merit}  

The proposed research will greatly expand our understanding of the adaptability of quantitative traits and the relationship this has with the architecture underlying such quantitative traits. Little is known about the genetic architecture of quantitative traits, yet most important traits are quantitative. With the availability of genomic and phenotypic data, this is an area now ripe for further research\kjg{I don't really like this sentence :/}. A standing question in evolutionary biology is whether adaptation generally happens from few loci of large effect or many loci of small effect. This is a difficult question to answer, as the detectability of small effect loci is limited. Traditionally, QTL and GWAS approaches can be used to find important genes underlying traits of interest, but suffer from the aforementioned problem of small effect size loci. This research proposes to resolve this issue and provide deeper insights into the genetic architecture of adaptation. Furthermore, conducting this research in the maize\//teosinte system informs future research on this important crop and breeding of the species for adapting to future climate change as well as advances our understanding of plant biology and plant genomics.


\paragraph{Broader Impacts}

The impacts of this research will span across both the scientific community and the broader public. The research components and results will be made publicly available online though repositories of simulation and analysis code as well as public archiving of the data used.


Broadly relevant because these results could inform on maintaining diversity in crops for the future in ways that may have much larger long term impacts in the maintenance of diversity as well as fitness/adaptation in the face of climate change and future adaptation to changing environmental conditions.
