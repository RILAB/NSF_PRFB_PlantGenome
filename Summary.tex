\required{Project Summary}

\paragraph{Overview} 
How does the genetic architecture of quantitative traits change as a result of demography and selection during the maize domestication bottleneck and the further bottleneck that some maize populations underwent from Central America to South America?
	
If we compare maize and teosinte (which are locally adapted in their respective pops), do we see evidence of:\\
	\indent - many genes of small effect or few genes of large effect underlying important traits?\\
	\indent - do these differences match our predictions based on their differing demographic histories?
	
Broadly relevant because these results could inform on maintaining diversity in crops for the future in ways that may have much larger long term impacts in the maintenance of diversity as well as fitness/adaptation in the face of climate change and future adaptation to changing environmental conditions.

 Prepare Project Summary (limited to one page) of Proposed Fellowship Activities, including both
research and training. Select GO next to Project Summary. This is an abstract of the proposed research
and training. You must clearly address and identify in separate statements using the three boxes: (1) an
overview of your proposed fellowship activities; (2) intellectual merit; and (3) broader impacts of the
activities. Without these 3 sections, your application will be returned without review. List your
sponsoring scientist(s) and institution(s) in the overview. Upload text in the proper boxes. Do not use
the Supplementary Document option for the summary. Do not use jargon and abbreviations in the
summary. It should be understandable by scientists not in your specialized field
