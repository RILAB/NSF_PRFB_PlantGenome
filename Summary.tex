\paragraph{Overview} 

The ability of organisms to adapt to new and changing conditions is vital in the face of climate and other anthropogenic changes. Understanding and predicting this ability to adapt for species is thus key, and is especially relevant in crop species that are needed to sustain food and fuel sources for the world's growing populations. This research project aims to examine the genetic architecture of important traits for adaptation in maize before and after its domestication bottleneck. Two major questions will be addressed: 1) what is the distribution of effect sizes for new mutations in genomic regions underlying important phenotypic traits in maize and teosinte, and 2) how do different histories of demography and selection change this genetic architecture over time and impact the species' ability to adapt? Vast resources of genomic and phenotypic data in both teosinte and maize create an ideal system in which to investigate these questions. Through four objectives I aim to answer these questions using both real and simulated data to create and test theoretical predictions in the system. I will first estimate the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations in teosinte, maize's progenitor, then use this information to parameterize and simulate the demographic and selective history of maize during its domestication. This creates expectations for how the genetic architecture of various traits, some of which are hypothesized to be under selection during domestication, may change and can be compared to real data to test if predictions match reality. These results can be validated using a synthetic \emph{Zea} line what contains both teosinte and maize in the same background. Further, to investigate a broader range of demographic and selective pressures, I will simulate the history of various landraces of maize that expanded across the Americas to assess further impacts of these forces on genetic architecture of important traits. This research will be conducted at the University of California, Davis, under the supervision of Dr. Jeffrey Ross\--Ibarra and co-supervised by Dr. Kevin Thornton at the University of California, Irvine.

\paragraph{Intellectual Merit}  

%\jri{this paragraph great for intellectual merit} These hypothesized changes in the DFE are not well understood in any system and are controversial in humans (cite lohmueller vs. pritchard etc.). Deleterious alleles likely play a large role in many adaptive phenotypes: crop plants have undergone dramatic demographic shifts, usually involving a domestication bottleneck followed by expansion as cultivation spread, and some authors even argue that selection on domestication traits has inadvertently increased the frequency of alleles deleterious for other phenotypes (cite gunther2010). Consistent with this, it has recently been shown that genes associated with a number of quantitative traits in maize are enriched for deleterious alleles compared to randomly chosen genes (cite mezmouk2014). Such information is crucial for understanding variation in phenotype, designing breeding strategies, utilizing diversity from wild relatives, or even engineering new traits using biotechnology. 


The proposed research will greatly expand our understanding of the adaptability of quantitative traits and the relationship this has with the architecture underlying such quantitative traits. Little is known about the genetic architecture of quantitative traits, yet most important traits are quantitative. A standing question in evolutionary biology is whether adaptation generally happens from few loci of large effect or many loci of small effect. This is a difficult question to answer, as the detectability of small effect loci is limited. Traditional QTL and GWAS approaches suffer from a lack of resolution required for understanding genetic architecture. This research proposes to resolve this issue and provide deeper insights into the genetic architecture of adaptation. Maize\//teosinte  serve as a perfect system for this study as it has the advantage of a known demographic and selective history (domestication) and both genomic and phenotypic data for populations were (maize) and were not (teosinte) subject to these selective and demographic forces. Furthermore, this work can inform future research on this important crop and breeding of this and other species for adapting to future climate change as well as advancing our understanding of plant biology and plant genomics. The results could inform crop studies in terms of maintaining genetic diversity for the future in ways that may have much larger long term impacts on the maintenance of diversity as well as on adaptation to changing environments.

\paragraph{Broader Impacts}

The impacts of this research will span across both the scientific community and the broader public. The research will be made publicly available at all stages through online repositories of simulation and analysis code as well by public archiving the data. Additionally, I will make published results available on public pre-print servers, or when possible in open-access journals. I have a strong record of conference attendance that I will maintain in order to present results to the scientific community, and will also use my presence on Twitter and as a contributor to The Molecular Ecologist online blog to more frequently reach both the scientific and public audiences. Furthermore, I will mentor undergraduate students in the lab, teaching skills on computational and genomics analyses and develop workshops on population and quantitative genetics and computational tools that I will organize to teach at the Langebio research center in Irapuato, Mexico. I will also have the opportunity to assist Dr. Ross-Ibarra in developing modules for his undergratuate genetics class as well as visit local high schools to introduce these ideas to students.

%and also be able to participate in the educational partnership that has been created between UC Davis and Pioneer High School in Woodland, California. This will allow me to visit high school classrooms to teach about the cutting edge of genomics and evolutionary biology research to young scientists as well as to potentially mentor high school students in the lab or on small-scale projects.

%\jri{didnt know about this. would have to get buy-in from brady/sinha. possible if you're interested, but if students want molecular bnechwork experience doesn't fit with current proposal...}. \jri{workshop on maize quant gen would be cool. have collaborators at Langebio in Irapuato where you could present. also could design a youtube video on it? another possibility -- i teach undergraduate genetics, and am in process of flipping classroom. you could help design modules (blog posts, videos, etc.) on pop and quant gen for that class, which would potentially could used for all the genetics students at UCD}.
% kind of just spitballing right now, need to make sure these things make sense/would work
