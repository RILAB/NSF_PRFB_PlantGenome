 Prepare Project Summary (limited to one page) of Proposed Fellowship Activities, including both
research and training. Select GO next to Project Summary. This is an abstract of the proposed research
and training. You must clearly address and identify in separate statements using the three boxes: (1) an
overview of your proposed fellowship activities; (2) intellectual merit; and (3) broader impacts of the
activities. Without these 3 sections, your application will be returned without review. List your
sponsoring scientist(s) and institution(s) in the overview. Upload text in the proper boxes. Do not use
the Supplementary Document option for the summary. Do not use jargon and abbreviations in the
summary. It should be understandable by scientists not in your specialized field
