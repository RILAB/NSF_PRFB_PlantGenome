\paragraph{Overview} 

The ability of organisms to adapt to new and changing conditions is vital in today's world of climate and other anthropogenic changes. Understanding and predicting this ability to adapt for species is thus key, and is especially relevant in crop species that are needed to sustain food and fuel sources for the world's growing populations. This research project aims to examine the genetic architecture of important traits for adaptation in maize before and after its domestication bottleneck. Two major questions will be addressed: 1) what is the distribution of effect sizes for mutations % reword? mutations don't underly the trait, loci do
underlying important phenotypic traits in maize and teosinte, and 2) how do different histories of demography and selection change this genetic architecture over time and impact the species' ability to adapt? Vast resources of genomic and phenotypic data in both teosinte and maize create an ideal system in which to investigate these questions. I propose three objectives to answer these questions using both real and simulated data to create and test theoretical predictions in the system. The first objective is to estimate the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations in teosinte, maize's progenitor. From this result, simulations in objective two will be parameterized and run to simulate % used simulate twice in same sentence, fix
the demographic and selective history of maize during its domestication. This creates an expectation for how the genetic architecture of traits in maize, hypothesized to be either under selection during the domestication event or not, should change given its past and can be compared to real data to see if predictions match reality. Objective three then performs further simulations of additional demographic and selective events that varying landraces of maize have experienced to assess if further changes to genetic architecture are detected. This research will be conducted at the University of California, Davis, under the supervision of Dr. Jeffrey Ross\--Ibarra and cosupervised by Dr. Kevin Thornton at the University of California, Irvine.

\paragraph{Intellectual Merit}  

The proposed research will greatly expand our understanding of the adaptability of quantitative traits and the relationship this has with the architecture underlying such quantitative traits. Little is known about the genetic architecture of quantitative traits, yet most important traits are quantitative. With the availability of genomic and phenotypic data, this is an area now ripe for further research %I don't really like this sentence
A standing question in evolutionary biology is whether adaptation generally happens from few loci of large effect or many loci of small effect. This is a difficult question to answer, as the detectability of small effect loci is limited. Traditionally, QTL and GWAS approaches can be used to find important genes underlying traits of interest, but suffer from the aforementioned problem of small effect size loci. This research proposes to resolve this issue and provide deeper insights into the genetic architecture of adaptation. Additionally, conducting this research in the maize\//teosinte system informs future research on this important crop and breeding of the species for adapting to future climate change as well as advances our understanding of plant biology and plant genomics. The results could inform % use the word inform too much
crop studies in terms of maintaining genetic diversity for the future in ways that may have much larger long term impacts on the maintenance of diversity as well as on adaptation to changing environments.

\paragraph{Broader Impacts}

The impacts of this research will span across both the scientific community and the broader public. The research components and results will be made publicly available  through online repositories of simulation and analysis code as well as public archiving of the data used. Additionally, I will make an effort to publish results from this work either in open-access journals % which is now crazy expensive, but budget could go to this though not top priority
or on public pre-print servers for other journals. I have a strong record of conference attendance that I will maintain in order to present results to the scientific community, and will also use my presence on Twitter and as a contributor to The Molecular Ecologist online blog to more frequently reach both the scientific and public audiences. Furthermore, I will mentor undergraduate students in the lab and also be able to participate in the educational partnership that has been created between UC Davis and Pioneer High School in Woodland, California\kjg{found this here: \url{http://www.dailydemocrat.com/general-news/20140307/uc-davis-partnership-with-pioneer-high-benefits-budding-scientists}}. This will allow me to visit high school classrooms to teach about the cutting edge of genomics and evolutionary biology research to young scientists as well as to potentially mentor high school students in the lab or on small-scale projects. % kind of just spitballing right now, need to make sure these things make sense/would work
\kjg{Jeff, do you have any collaborators in Mexico or S. America where I could go and teach some sort of workshop on genomics or computational skills for year 3 or something? if so, could be a good thing to propose here, or does that not make sense if they're more doing the field work with maize?}
