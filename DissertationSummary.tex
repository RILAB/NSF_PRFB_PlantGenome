%\section*{Dissertation Summary}
\indent A major obstacle in evolutionary biology is the difficulty of population genetic inference in the face of confounding factors, such as demographic history. My dissertation work has focused on several topics related to this broader area of research:
\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
\item Estimating effective population sizes from genetic data in the face of migration
\item Evaluating the factors related to species' abilities to locally adapt at range edges during expansion
\item Validating SNP loci under selection in lodgepole pine (\emph{Pinus contorta}) for local adaptation to climate
\end{enumerate}

talk about NE work

talk about range edge stuff

talk about adaptree stuff
