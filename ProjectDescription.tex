\section*{A. Introduction}


talk about demographic history broadly and the difficulties it causes

talk about genetic architecture broadly and how important it is to understand for adaptation etc 

then go into how we expect the combination of demog and seln to interact and change genetic architecture in different ways

we cam look at this in maize as it makes a great system to compare two closely related species before and after different demog processes. it also has vast amounts of genomic data available allowing us to investigate the genetic architecture of these pops

\subsection*{Objective I: Investigate the genetic architecture of important traits in teosinte}

This first objective aims to estimate the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) in teosinte (\emph{genus spp}).

Maize was domesticated in...

\section*{D. Career Development \& Future Research}

My career goal is to become an independent, academic researcher who is able to push the boundaries of population genetics and evolutionary biology. As I have in my dissertation research, I aim to study population genetic and genomic processes both empirically from real work data and theoretically through simulations. I believe one of the strongest ways to advance our knowledge is through such comparisons of situations where every parameter, current and historical, is known, as well as the evolutionary outcome (simulations) to natural situations where processes or effects that are poorly understood or still unknown to us can diverge from theoretical expectations and provide the basis for further study and investigation into these processes.

The skills I will develop during this fellowship will benefit my career and put me on the cutting edge for analyses of the newest genomic data and the most recent computational approaches for biological simulations. First, I will gain many skills related to genomic data analysis throughout the course of this research. I have minimal exposure and experience directly working with such data from my dissertation, thus making htis a vital opportunity. Genomic technology and data are growing at an incredibly fast pace, and working directly with such data will teach me the most up to date, accurate, and efficient approaches. I will also improve my skills of computational biology through the proposed simulations and be able to learn a new and useful programming language used widely in evolutionary biology, Python. Drs. Ross\--Ibarra and Thornton are both at the forefront of a popular \kjg{think of better word?} movement for open science, making all stages of the research process transparent to any interested parties, and providing products such as data and code immediately and publicly. This is a work ethic I strongly agree with and hope to contribute to as an independent researcher. Our work together will better equip me with the tools and experience that make open science easy, efficient, and profitable for all. Interacting with Drs. Ross\--Ibarra and Thornton, as well as other researchers at UC Davis, on a regular basis will be both intellectually stimulating and rewarding experiences that will help me accomplish my career goals.

\section*{E. Sponsoring Scientists and Host Institution}

The University of California Davis (UCD) is the ideal place to conduct the proposed research. UCD has a world-renowned program in evolutionary biology and faculty in population genetics who are at the top of the field. Jeff Ross\--Ibarra is an expert on teosinte, maize, its domestication, and the associated population genetics and genomics of the system. \kjg{Jeff, feel free to make that sound better} 
Kevin Thornton is an accomplished quantitative geneticist and computational biologist who will also contribute greatly to this research. \kjg{Likewise Kevin, feel free to modify}
They will both serve as effective and capable mentors for my post-doctoral research. In particular, Jeff has been studying the maize\//teosinte system for \emph{XX}\kjg{don't forget to fill in} years with a great network of collaborators providing vast resources of data. His work has contributed largely to our knowledge of this system, and more generally on domestication and adaptation as evolutionary processes. Kevin is also the developer and maintainer of fwdpy, the python package proposed for completing the simulations in Objective 2. He will thus serve as a great resource in terms of knowing the exact capabilities of the simulation method and any assumptions of its model that must be taken into account.
Furthermore, the Department of Ecology and Evolution, the Department of Plant Biology, and the Department of Plant Sciences at UCD have many exceptional faculty doing research relevant to my interests, providing many research groups to interact with on a daily basis for potential collaborations or feedback on this research. For example, I look forward to interacting with scientists interested in population genetics, such as Graham Coop, and in adaptation, such as Johanna Schmitt. %Additionally, experts in plant regulatory evolution, such as Neelima Sinha, Siobhan Brady, and Daniel Runcie will serve as great people to interact with. % need to look up people in the dept, these names were just taken from Emily J's application
UCD has the necessary computing resources for our proposed work, and as described, vast sources of knowledge and experience on the topics I plan to investigate, ensuring the success of this work. I am excited to join and contribute to UCD's active and vibrant scientific community.

\kjg{want to do the DFE of maize and teosinte at the same time? no reason we can't right, and then do the simulations. Though if it takes time, teosinte should be prioritized so the sims can be parameterized and started while the maize DFE is estimated}
