annote = {-natrl seln and sexual seln can interact
-sexual seln can impede natrl seln by causing antagonistic demands on phenotypes or conflict between the sexes, constraining them from their optimum fitness
- sexual seln can reinforce natrl seln by increasing seln against deleterious alleles or for adaptive alleles
- sexual seln allows the potential for load b/c of sexual conflict which can reduce fitness at the same time that fitness may be enhanced at other loci by sexual seln
-local adaptation: males adapted to one environment should be better at attracting mates in that environment compared to males from other environments
-large breeding pops were evolved at diff. temp. treatments for 2 years
- found no significance in the proportion of adapted male matings
- maybe 2 years wasn't long enough to become locally adapted
- do drosophila differ in the success after mating? i.e. sperm competition or something?
-not many other papers on the topic with evidence for this
-ask Sam about temp adapted drosophila lines
-have to first see if natr'l selection is strong giving enough reason to see if sexual seln differed
-maybe try in a diff. spp  -{\&}gt; look up other local adaptation studies; needs to be an outcrosser and able to study sexual seln
-could be something besides temp. too; toxins or heavy metal adaptations; anything chronic (exposed throughout life)

-would need the starting materials; can't use naturally occurring local adaptation in case they've evolved reproductive isolation

-sometime one way local adaptation is tested, ex. some normal, some starved; probably already review articles

CONDITION DEPENDENT

-in plants; for a given resource allocation, is there a gene/mutation that correlate with overall better or worse function; could see better mating success for locally adapted plants

month = mar,
annote = {-clinal variation in genetically determined traits is attributed to adaptation to local conditions along an env. gradient
-does selection account for clinal variation in the highly heritable pheomelanin color trait of owls?
-compared spatial differentiation of color and of neutral genes among pops.
-low differentiation shows gene flow, consistent with selection as the cause, so color cline most likely result of local adaptation
-env.s are not constant in space or time
-pop.s adapt in evolutionary time to this (local adaptation)
-probably what maintains phenotypic and genotypic diversity in and amongst pop.s
-gene flow can move adapted ind.s away from the local optima
-but, if gene flow can be restricted if seln is so high to reduce immigrant success
-Qst = pop. differentiation at a quantitative trait; for neutrally evolving pops, it should be the same as Fst (genetic differentiation at neutral markers)
-to see if selection caused clinal color variation, compare Qst to Fst
- Dest = differentiation statistic, partitions total genetic variance into independent w/in and among pop components to prevent deflated differentiation measures
- Rst (Slatkin's) accounts for microsat mutation pattern, better when mutation is more imp. than migration
-if geographically disruptive seln is stronger than gene flow, phenotypes will diverge more markedly among pop.s with increasing distance
- Pst = pseudo Qst (Qst estimated from assumption on the determinism of the trait under study) ???
-found low neutral genetic structure (Fst = 0.011)
-found more color differentiation than genetic differentiation (30-fold larger)
-overall: clinal coloration is due to local adaptation, not drift (in the barn owl)
-if it had been neutral, high gene flow would have eliminated it

title = {{NATURAL SELECTION IN POPULATIONS SUBJECT TO A MIGRATION LOAD}},
journal = {Evolution},
year = {2007},
volume = {61},
number = {9},
pages = {2229--2243},
month = sep,
annote = {-migration opposes selection, constraining divergence among pops -{\&}gt; called migration load
-they make a 2-island model of migration-selection balance that reflects the natr'l history of walking sticks of 2 host plant spp that favor diff. cryptic color patterns
-how migration rates affect level of maladaptation w/in pops (frequency of 
-selection differential (w/in generation morph frequency change)
-25 natr'l pops
-maladaptation higher in pops getting more immigrants
-increased maladaptation leads to larger selection differentials
-immigration elevates the variance in fitness, leading to larger selection differentials, consistent with Fisher's theorem of natural selection
-BUT recurrent adult migration between parapatric pops may tend to obscure the effects of seln
-Fisher's theorem: The rate of increase in the mean fitness of any organism at any time ascribable to natural selection acting through changes in gene frequencies is exactly equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time
-migration = gene flow
-migration: 1) limits phenotypic and genetic divergence, 2) loss in mean fitness of a pop from immigration of locally maladapted alleles (migration load)
- it is possible for migration to also bring in good alleles though, just like in mutation
- in addition to stopping divergence, migration can also DISPLACE POPS FROM THEIR LOCAL ADAPTIVE PEAKS
-when there is more migration load, should also be more directional selection to purge out the maladaptive genotypes
-ex - the water snakes on Lake Erie -banded morphs favored on mainland, not on rocky islands
-thus, recurrent immigration may mean that no long-term change in trait frequencies or means occurs over generations
-defn: selection differential = unstandardized difference in trait frequencies w/in a pop before and after a bout of seln
-selection intensity = seln differential is standardized by the trait variance
-migration load = higher differential but not necessarily higher intensity
-GOOD APPROACH: compare seln differential across multiple pops w/ varying levels of migration load; show that 1) more immigration = more maladaptation, 2) more maladaptation = stronger seln differential
-parapatric = neighbors nearby are on a diff. host plant
-they contrasted low and high migration settings by comparing allopatric and parapatric pops
-?? if they define allopatric as being {\&}gt;50 times the per generation dispersal distance, how can there be low migration??  they say that mtDNA shows low migration, but it is unclear to me; if one migrates that far, it must be either extremely fit or the exact opposite (going so far b/c it is sick or dying?) (page 2230, right side) especially if the theory is that dispersal only occurs from larvae hatching and climbing onto a nearby plant (page 2231 left side)
-larger pops nearby = more immigration
-color morphs are genetically determined, divergence occurs b/c of visual predation, but both morphs occur on each host, just in diff. frequencies
-migration is early in life, 50% of ind.s stay on same plant their whole life
-estimate selection differential by contrasting frequency of the morph in winter against freq. in spring b/c seln will eliminate many immigrants in between since immigration mainly occurs early in the generation
-model: in a given pop, 3 possibilities: the adapted homozygote, a heterozygote, and the maladapted homozygote
-A = adaptive allele, M = maladaptive allele, p=freq. of adaptive allele, m=fraction of individuals that migrated away
-looked at consequences of which host plant one was on, and result of asymmetrical migration b/c of unequal sizes of parapatric pops
-pops with large neighbors showed more maladaptive morphs as expected
-maladaptation increases at a faster rate as the neighboring pop size increases; particularly pronounced when strong seln
-why do we assume there is a mutation selection balance ??? confused on the bottom right of 2233 ?  "at equilibrium, increased freq. of adaptive allele due to seln must be exactly countered by decreased frequency due to immigration"  why/how can they assume that pops are in a migration-selection equilibrium???
-in parapatric pops, host, relative patch size, and level of maladaptation contribute to variation in selection differentials
-stronger seln differentials occurred on adenostoma
-for a given level of maladaption, pops w/ small neighbors showed a larger seln differential than pops w/ large neighbors
-pops with more immigration tend to be more maladaptive; already known, this showed support
-increased maladaptation coincides with a larger seln differential
-looks like migration could be more one-sided or weaker seln on cenothis}

annote = {M=model
D=data

Bayes rule = P(M|D) = P(D|M)xP(M) / P(D)

P(D|M) = the likelihood
divide to normalize the likelihood distribution

P(D) = sum of all terms in the numerator  (sum of P(D|M)zP(M) ) i.e. sum over all possible models

if you can calculate just the likelihood function, you can use MCMC to get the rest

can integrate under the likelihood function to get the denominator

IF you know nothing at all: can simulate your data (D') based on p' (your candidate model)

if D'=D then p' is from your posterior distribution, i.e. you draw and accept that value

P(p')xP(d|p')/sum(P(x)xP(D|x))

where x is all possible values of p' in your distribution

BUT very difficult for your simulation to come up with the exact data you have, so we summarize it to be simpler -{\&}gt; a sufficient statistic = a reduction in the data that is equivalent to working with the full data (reduces dimensionality of the data)

often a sufficient statistic is not available

so we had D=D' and S(D) = S(D') summary of data = summary of simulated data
but now: |S(D) - S(D')| {\&}lt; epsilon (some small value)

still a very slow method
acceptance rate = p' being in the posterior


2 families of methods:
can make epsilon bigger -{\&}gt; broader dist. of posterior, could get multiple peaks unknowingly, but (fig 1) can use a regression method (if you zoom in far enough, everything is linear) and can use relationship between sum stat and parameter, and project onto axis (green histogram)
each orange dot is an accepted p' from one simulation, and each summary stat is plotted, then within value of epsilon

you would ideally want all orange dots on the vertical dashed line because those are D=D' but because this happens rarely, we go out a distance epsilon, assuming that these points are representative of the same variance at that point of D=D'.  correct for the "wiggle room" made by introducing epsilon by doing a regression of these points and plotting those residuals


there is thus discrimination against models with more parameters

Bayesian information criterion - ranks of models, penalizes ones with more parameters

the probability of the right model goes down with the more complex models and parameters you introduce

other method - importance sampling - when you see that some areas of your prior return nothing, sample higher in other areas to look for other likely candidates

annote = {- amounts of mutation influence different measures of differentiation
-so Gst, D, etc have been introduced
-Fst is a more important summary statistic; Rst or measures that explicitly account for mutation are better than Gst or D
-overall, markers with lower mutation rates are easier to interpret
-Fst can be used as a coalescent description: time to the most recent common ancestor for alleles within and between populations; in this case is unaffected by mutation   ?had not heard of this before?
-Fstcoal measures the proportion of recent evolutionary history shared by alleles of the same pop.; so measures pop. isolation
-for microsats, PHIst and Rst can use the similarity of alleles to infer time to common ancestor
-mutation can lower Fst b/c can lead to high levels of heterozygosity AND also by making diverged pop.s more similar via homoplasy
-Fst useful for 2 reasons: 1. it can be empirically measured from genetic marker data, 2. a set of loci can be identified that give nearly independent replicate measures of the demographic history of the pop.s
-Gst meant to deal with multiple alleles at a locus; ~=Fst
-Gst fault 1: even for totally isolated pops, will never = 1 because it is defined in terms of heterozygosity
-when migration {\&}gt;{\&}gt; mutation (m{\&}gt;{\&}gt;u) Gst is not much affected by mutation; but if u{\&}gt;m then migration becomes unimportant and mutation affects it heavily
-so Gst not really useful
-G'st=Gst/maximumGst, making a value between 0 and 1
-Jost's D measures relative differentiation: deviations from total differentiation -- it indicates the proportion of allelic diversity among pop.s versus Fst which is the variance of allele frequencies among pop.s
-D is good in that it is the same as Fst at 0 and 1
-better to call D a genetic distance measure b/c it shows the genetic distance between pop.s
-when u{\&}lt;{\&}lt;m right sides of graphs in fig. 1: Fst and Gst similar, G'st and D pretty far off, and usually a higher estimate
-when u{\&}gt;m (happens with microsats and relatively isolated pops) Gst is much lower than Fst (left side of fig 1 graphs)
D and G'st were meant to address the errors of Gst caused by high diversity within pop.s
-Fst is good to know because it is similar locus to locus, perhaps we estimate it imperfectly sometimes but the underlying quantity is of interest and we can address bias in other ways
-D is a good measure, but doesn't really tell us anything about evolution or the pop.s themselves; it is insensitive to important evolutionary processes and really only tells us about specific loci, not pop.s
-SNPs better than microsats b/c less mutation
-Fst is affected by mutation!!!
-came about with allozymes where mutation rate was not a big effect
-people still do Fst with microsats b/c SNPs are still expensive

month = apr,
annote = {-QST is a commonly used metric of the degree of genetic differentiation among populations displayed by quantitative traits
-if QST = FST, this is taken as evidence of spatially heterogeneous and diversifying selection.
-For a single trait, QST must be compared not to the mean FST but to the distribution of FST values
-That `2' for the diploid case comes from the fact that the quantitative genetic variance among populations is proportional to two times FST (Wright 1951)
-First, they assume that the traits and genes are neutral;
-Second, these analyses assume that the traits are determined by genes that interact additively both within (i.e. no dominance) and between (i.e. no epistasis) loci
-neutral traits exhibiting additive-by-additive epistasis would on average have QSTs less than neutral FST.
-**In general, it seems that dominance and simple epistasis are unlikely to cause a large increase in QST for a neutral trait, but these nonadditive genetic factors can easily cause the QST of a neutral trait to be much lower than FST. 
-Given that dominance and epistasis affect a large fraction of traits (Crnokrak {\&}amp; Roff 1995; Whitlock et al. 1995), this is a major obstacle to interpreting low QST as evidence for spatially uniform stabilizing selection.
-under the null hypothesis that traits are neutral, linkage disequilibrium should not affect the mean value of QST
-FST --- and particularly QST --- can be estimated with bias. Given that the sources of bias are different in the two measures, in practice, estimates of FST are unlikely to equal estimates of QST even for neutral loci and traits.
-it is crucial for valid comparisons that the FST and QST measurements be taken on exactly the same collection of populations.
-the FST and QST of neutral traits and loci are expected to vary greatly, even for a given mean value
-estimates of FST are extremely heterogeneous among loci.
-FST estimates vary among loci for four reasons: direct selection, indirect effects of selection, sampling error during observation, or genetic drift
-Selection is only expected to systematically and strongly affect FST when the fitness differences in alleles across populations is greater than the migration rate
-*if some loci undergo selection, the Fst for them will vary, so heterogeneous Fst's can be a signal of selection

-FST is a function of local allele frequencies, and genetic drift can cause any function of allele frequency to change stochastically. Different loci may share the same demographic history, but each locus will have its own idiosyncratic genealogical history. As a result, FST can vary from locus to locus because of heterogeneity in the details of the coalescent process for each locus. Even for loci that are unaffected by selection and that are exhaustively sampled, variation in evolutionary history causes heterogeneity among loci in FST

-heterogeneity in FST caused by drift is in many cases the largest component of heterogeneity in FST among loci
-However, if the number of demes in the real population is limited, then there is a minimum variance in FST caused by heterogeneity in the populations' histories of drift which cannot be avoided by larger samples. If the number of populations is relatively small, then this heterogeneity is usually the dominant source of variance in FST among loci. 
-or neutral traits, the distribution of possible QST values is approximately the same as the distribution of neutral FST values for a single locus (see Figs 1 and 5).**** Even though a trait may be controlled by many genes, the variation in evolutionary history does not reduce the heterogeneity in QST relative to FST, because drift also induces linkage disequilibrium at random among loci affecting a trait
-***In effect, the increases in trait value in a deme caused by drift at one locus are balanced by decreases by drift at other loci; the consequence is that QST of one trait has the same amount of information about evolutionary history as does the FST of a single locus.
-the expected distribution of neutral QST can be relatively reliably inferred from the mean value of FST calculated from several neutral loci
-there are several biases which may affect QST estimation: traits chosen for QST analysis are often traits already thought to be under spatially varying selection
-If a trait is chosen for QST analysis based on the observation that it seems to be geographically variable, then the statistical comparison of its QST to FST cannot reliably tell us whether selection has caused the divergence.
-Most additional biases associated with QST are well known from classical quantitative genetics. Estimating QST requires unbiased estimates of both the additive genetic variance within populations...}

-determine what pop. characteristic = max. fitness for each env. type
- i.e. they establish a coorrespondence between optimal pop/spp structure and the pattern of env. heterogeneity in space and time

-define fitness so that interpop. selection changes a spp to the optimum fitness
-assume pops are static and unchanging over time; optimal for constant env. situations or no correlation between env.s of successive generations
-assume the env. is 2 discrete alternative niches/planes where each has a diff. optimal phenotype
-they occur in the proportions p and 1-p
-ind. fitness is assumed to depend on the phenotype of the ind. and the env. but not the spp composition
-section 1: multi-dimensional representation of the fitness of individuals and pop.s
-section 2: introduces the adaptive function as a measure of fitness of the whole pop.
-section 3: examine several environmental patterns
-section 4: biological meaning of form as related to homeostasis and degree of difference between niches
- ***(some of the discussion and conclusions are in the next Levins paper) that paper also relaxes the assumption that ind.s are independent of pop composition and are randomly distributed}

annote = {Falconer (1952) first noted that a character expressed in two environments can be viewed as two characters which are genetically correlated. This view is an essential feature of the present models: a separate variable is defined for the expression of a given trait in each environment. this is the character state

High positive genetic correlations between character states in different environments cause an overshoot of the optimum in the environment where the initial mean phenotype was well adapted, while negative genetic correlations lead to similar maladaptive evolution in the opposite direction. As expected from the eigenvalues, high genetic correlations of either sign also substantially decrease the rate of approach to the joint optimum; in both cases, some evolution must occur in a direction with a very small eigenvalue


The.difference in the adaptive landscapes for the two modes of selection is reflected in the evolutionary trajectories which are expected following a perturbation. Under hard selection, even a small asymmetry in the initial location of the phenotype in the two niches relative to the joint optimum (Fig. 2B, D) causes evolution of the character state expressed in the environment with the lowest initial mean fitness (here, 2,) to be dominated by the correlated response to selection on the character state in the other environment.

When that character state (2,) ap- proaches its optimum, the intensity of selection on it will diminish and the char- acters in other environments will begin to proceed more directly toward their op- tima. Only if no asymmetries exist in the
variances, the selection parameters, or the initial distance from the phenotypic op- timum in the two environments, will the evolutionary trajectories of the mean phenotypes proceed directly toward the optimum regardless of the cross-environ- ment genetic correlation


If the genetic correlation of character states in two environments is fI, then G is sin- gular and no genetic variation exists for evolution in one of the principle direc- tions in phenotype space (one of the eigenvalues will be zero). Almost any perturbation from the joint optimum will then result in a permanent displacement of the population from the optimum.


1. genotype-environment interaction as genetic correlation
2. genetic models of panmictic populations (soft and hard seln)
3. genetic models of subdivided pops

hard selection = global regulation
soft selection = local regulation}

-why is there sex?  must know why there is recombination first
-one theory: recombination has evolved b/c it reduces genetic associations (linkage disequilibria)
-one source of linkage disequilibria is the effect of migration in a heterogeneous env.
-w/ local differences in gene freq.s maintained by natr'l seln, when migration occurs, the differences can create linkage disequilibria w/in a patch and create selective pressure on recombination
-spatial heterogeneity in seln: 1) diff alleles favored in diff env.s, 2) strength, not sign of seln varies among env.s, 3) variation among env.s in the way alleles interact
-modifier approach: analyze precisely and quantitatively the outcome of indirect seln on transmission-related traits by tracking changes in allele freq. at a neutral modifier locus that affects some aspects of the genetic system
-they analyze the evolution of recombination when loci are polymorphic for 3 reasons: 1)equil is reached between mutations that are deleterious in both patches and selection, 2) a balance is struck by migration between a patch where an allele is favored and one where it is disfavored, 3) alleles that are beneficial in both patches increase in frequency; i.e. 1=mutation-selection equil, 2=migration-selection equil, 3=sweep of beneficial mutations
-whether covariance is positive or negative is based on the difference of the slopes, not just if they intersect or not
- depending on the trait values, generalists or specialists can be generated from selection/migration, and depending on the covariance
-local adaptation with 2 alleles being favored in one spot and another 2 favored in another strongly generates linkage disequilibrium

-Tajima's D (equals theta) is a statistical test created by and named after the Japanese researcher Fumio Tajima. The purpose of the test is to distinguish between a DNA sequence evolving randomly ("neutrally") and one evolving under a non-random process, including directional selection or balancing selection, demographic expansion or contraction, genetic hitchhiking, or introgression. A randomly evolving DNA sequence contains mutations with no effect on the fitness and survival of an organism.
-pairwise difference = differences between pairs of samples, pi = the average of the pairwise differences
-Tests for multiple loci include the HKA test described by Hudson et al (1987). This test is based on the idea that in the absence of selection, the expected number of polymorphic (segregating) sites within species and the expected number of 'fixed' differences between species (divergence) are both proportional to the mutation rate, and the ratio of them should be the same for all loci. Variation in the ratio of divergence to polymorphism among loci suggests selection.

annote = {-divergence hitchhiking = decreased surrounding loci under divergent seln generate large regions of differentiation within the genome ('genome islands')
-depending on the size of the island, could promote speciation?
-look at the neutral sites around the selected sites
-regions of differentiation do not extend far along the chromosome unless both Ne and migration rates are low; multiple loci make the region larger but result in genome-wide divergence

-when pops diverge and speciate, during the process, some areas of the genome diverge also but others do not due to gene flow or not enough time for drift, etc
-divergent seln contributes to this variation in differentiation b/c these loci do not move between pops easily thus accentuating divergence of regions under seln
-outlier loci = loci whose genetic divergence exceeds neutral expectation, putatively b/c of divergent seln
-so the idea is that speciation may still be possible when gene flow occurs
-divergent seln reduces interbreeding of pops, i.e. reduces immigrants and hybrids
-and thus reduces recombination
-allows regions of differentiation to build up at and around the divergently selected loci
-the size of the region under seln will influence the amount speciation is affected
-observations suggest that these regions of differentiation can be small
-2 main factors in divergence hitchhiking: 1. reduced gene flow around selected sites, accentuating differentiation, and 2. opportunity for this to facilitate further divergence, acting as a nuclei for speciation
-barrier strength = degree to which gene flow of a neutral marker was reduced between hybridizing pops due to divergent seln
-can get Fst from migration; lower m = bigger barrier = higher Fst (more structure)
-??? maybe we could just go through each of the equations to make sure I get it ???
-pi symbolizes population genetic differentiation
-computer simulation approximates effective migration (m sub e)
-the model allowed for equilibrium to be reached at locus 2 (the selected locus), then migration was modeled (a pulse-chase) where the fate of that allele at locus 1 gave the introgression rate of the neutral marker
-to analyze multiple loci under seln, modify the defn of migration
-in general, divergence hitchhiking did not generate large regions of neutral differentiation except in certain cases of small migration rates and pop sizes
-Fst values for a neutral locus linked to a single gene under seln are not expected to be large
-divergence hitchhiking is not substantial in the early stages of speciation when only one locus is under disruptive seln
- ???  so this looks at if a nearby NEUTRAL loci would be affected, but what if the nearby locus is being convergently selected upon; it will just be dependent on the strengths of seln ???
-higher Fst results with: stronger seln, smaller pops, less migration, and more loci under seln, and less recombination
-?? how realistic is it for multiple loci like this to be divergently selected upon?  if they are not QTLs...
-fig 6 shows a switch (more so in C and D): initially the instance of fewer loci decreases less in Fst, but then becomes lower in Fst than the more loci instance
- ??? they find that when more loci are under seln, more likely for speciation/divergence, but is this assuming that these loci are adjacent, or does location matter? ???
-3 stages of 'speciation with gene flow': establishment of initial genetic differentiation at one or a few loci, period where enough genetic change has accumulated to reduce effective migration at sites physically proximate to those under seln (divergence hitchhiking strongest at this stage; mutation nearby can also accentuate the effects), and third stage = gene flow becomes extensively reduced across the whole genome b/c many loci are now under seln and diverging
-disruptive seln less effective when the seln occurs prior to migration, i.e. juveniles are selected
-further work should look at the extent to which divergence hitchhiking can grow during speciation

-overall it was an okay paper, and the idea of divergence hitchhiking is neat and interesting, but the fact that it occurs in such limited cases and that these cases (low migration, small pop size) already seem ideal for speciation to occur makes it seem somewhat less important
-they assume that the selected loci are all unlinked which shouldn't be possible, esp. when r=0.1
-effective migration = long term genetic contribution of migrants to the pop
-think of effective migration as Fisher's expected reproductive value: the reproductive value of the migrant}

annote = {-evolutionary constraint = bias or limitation in phenotypic variation produced by a biological system
-4 major causes of phenotypic constraint: physiochemical, selective, genetic, and developmental
-genome-scale metabolic networks: chemical rxns that synthesize all small molecules in biomass from environmental nutrients; produce energy and 2ndary metabolites
-regulatory circuits: interacting gene products that influence the biological activity of each other
-macromolecules: catalyze chemical rxns, exchange chemicals between cells and env., structural support, locomotion, and transport
-can use these 3 systems to gain a better understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype
-canalizing seln = stabilizing seln
-stasis = absence of evolutionary change - occurs for 2 main reasons: an organism's phenotype is optimal in the given env or phenotypic variability is present but not the right kind of phenotypic variation (there is a superior phenotype, it has just not yet been 'discovered') via evolution
-3 observations:  1) the processes of phenotype formation are at the root of physiochemical constraints on phenotypic variation; 2) these processes create internally heterogeneous genotype networks which are responsible for selective constraints including those caused by canalizing seln; 3) the distribution of phenotypes in genotype space is a consequence of the processes that produce phenotypes from genotypes, this distribution is the origin of genetic constraints
-thus, constraints emerging from the production of phenotypes are ultimately the cause of the 3 other classes of constraints
-canalizing seln does NOT equal stabilizing seln, it is more like a reduction in phenotypes; by defn: canalizing selection The elimination of genotypes that render developing individuals sensitive to environmental fluctuations. Genetic differences may be revealed in organisms by placing them in a stressful environment, or if a severemutation stresses the developmental system.}

Both lack and excess of summary statistics can be troublesome for model selec- tion. Unfortunately, there is still no general rule or method as to which and how many summary statistics should be used in an ABC analysis. Recent improve- ments of ABC get round this problem using dimension reduction techniques, including a nonlinear feed-for- ward neural network (Blum {\&}amp; Francois 2010) and par- tial least squares regression (Wegmann et al. 2009). These types of algorithms have not been implemented yet in the DIYABC package. The added value of such algorithms in the context of complex models and large data sets remains, however, to be thoroughly tested

Our results based on the analyses of controlled simu- lated data sets show that when an invasive species is genetically structured in its native area, the ability of ABC analyses to infer invasion routes correctly may be

In particular, in the simplest case when genetic struc- ture exists within each of two main genetic clusters (as found for H. axyridis), ABC analyses often erroneously select a scenario of admixture between the two clusters when the true scenario is a simple origin, without admixture, from an unsampled population from one of the two clusters}

annote = {-classically, one mutation results in the favorable allele
-this ignores the other possibility that beneficial alleles can enter a pop recurrently via mutation or migration meaning that several origins contribute to the fixation of said allele
-thus, more linked haplotypes can remain in the pop affecting the pattern of a selective sweep on linked neutral variation

-selective sweeps, AKA genetic hitchhiking result in reduced genetic variation b/c it takes linked stretches of DNA with it to fixation
-ancestral variation is only maintained if recombination breaks the association of the region
-standing variation or recurrent mutation/migration have similar results
-SOFT SWEEP = descendants of more than one copy of the selected allele are involved in the selective sweep
-HARD SWEEP = only recombination maintains ancestral variation
-soft sweeps are likely under biologically realistic conditions

-assume complete linkage
-one locus, haploid pop, 2 alleles
-initially monomorphic pop
-modeled either mutation or migration as the cause of introducing the beneficial allele
- alpha=selection, theta=selection, M=mutation

-probability that lines coalesce before a mutation = Phard = 1- Psoft where Psoft is the probability that mutation happens before coalescence
-Probability that one of the lineages mutated = Pmut
xtau = frequency of B (beneficial allele) at time tau
-Tfix = avg fixation time for B
-Phard and soft are not underlain by any stochasticity
-only Tfix depends on this and thus on the selection coefficient
-very precise estimate if Tfix/Ne {\&}lt;{\&}lt;1
-do not necessarily have to sample right after fixation occurs

-larger sample sizes:
-k={\#} ancestors
-this changes the eqns for probability of mutation and coalescence
-Psoft increases with increasing pop size
-ancestral haplotypes of low frequency will slowly drift out of the pop and remaining haplotypes become more uniformly distributed
-with high recurrent mutation rates almost all selective sweeps are soft
-probability of a soft sweep also increases with stronger selection strength

-Migration:
--fixed probability m for an individual to be replaced by B
-treat one deme as entirely the reservoir providing B to the second deme
-each new B migrant adds a new haplotype, so can use a neutral coalescent to model it

-positive seln removes genetic variation -- reduced variation around a selected site; this can be used to detect loci that underlie adaptation

-for pop-level mutation rate {\&}lt;0.01, soft sweeps rare, {\&}gt;0.01 they are observable, 0.01{\&}lt;theta{\&}lt;1 soft sweeps coexist w/ hard sweeps, {\&}gt;1 almost all adaptive substitutions are soft sweeps
-recurrent migration and mutation are analagous; seln strength, dominance, etc. are minor roles

**-pop structure should make soft sweeps more likely, ex subpops linked by weak migration where migration is less than mutation, it is more likely for mutation leading to adaptation to result in B which means we see a soft sweep at the metapop level
-  ** meaning that less connectivity reduces migration, so simultaneous mutation in diff. subpops maintain ancestral haplotype variation


?bottom left of p. 1077, what do they mean by a soft sweep within an individual?

?Wright-Fisher model? right of p.1077 and in figure  I don't understand what is being shown in the closeup of the timestep

-the calculations are based only on the sample, and thus can't infer about the population; would need to check in the paper, but it might be possible that it could not apply to the whole population because of assumptions they made

-input from migration could have much, much different ancestral haplotypes and have a greater contribution to diversity

These findings appear to agree with our results, as the previous studies found strong divergence in natterjack toad larval life histories between the west coast and southern Swedish popula- tions (a distance of 􏰦150 km, Rogell et al. 2009), whereas differentiation among the west coast popula- tions is minor (this study). However, studies on molec- ular variation of the southern Swedish populations remain to be carried out.}

Kingsolver 2001 strength of selection on natural populations - review paper

on the boundary where a is close to k, you are on the boundary of stabilizing and diversifying selection

why is there so much genetic variation? mutation rates are much too low.  this shows that diversifying selection may be the cause

diversifying selection can happen in one direction while stabilizing happens in another, how to identify which traits go which way?

for quantitative traits, uusu. assume that loci are additive, but if not, there can be epistasis and thus disruptive selection on varying loci can have a different outcome}

what is demic diffusion? page 490.  just what it sounds like?

whereas advantageous mutations can also travel back and propagate in the already occupied world.

recurrent founder effects were not taken into account, meaning they didn't have continuous immigration?

only done 2-D space, is more of a 3-D spread, i.e. into all (or just more) directions, not linear feasible/interesting?

fast contraction loses less diversity

Storfer et al. 2007

we don't really have bottlenecks, so might not see the the decrease in genetic diversity that Austerlitz et al associated with range expansions

could look at deleterious vs neutral vs adaptive mutations, a la figure 4?  mutations do not = SNPs though, but if this pattern is seen, could be a way to tell if a snp is locally adaptive or causes migration load???
could surfing eliminate local adaptation as the range expands?

FUTURE ISSUES
1. Integration of realistic spatial range expansions into a statistical inferential framework for the estimation of demographic, mutation, and selection parameters.
2. Disentangling signatures of spatial expansions from signatures of selection, and designing new ways to detect loci under selection.

Does migration from differentially adapted populations increase or decrease the potential for local adaptation? Is the answer the same when populations are considered at different spatial scales?
􏱝 Does genetic variation for adaptive traits generally increase or decrease towards range margins? Is genetic variation more abundant in contracting versus expanding species' edges? If so, does such variation make local adaptation more probable?
􏱝 Are range margins found where selective gradients are locally steep and/or populations are reduced in size? How often do interactions with other species determine parapatric range margins? Do the same ecological and genetic factors determine internal as well as external species' edges?

Rule 6- Change scales in mid-axis
Rule 7- Emphasize the trivial, ignore the important
Rule 8- Jiggle the baseline
Rule 9- Austria first (do not always alphabetize data entries)
Rule 10- Label (a) illegibly, (b) incompletely, (c) incorrectly, and (d) ambiguously
Rule 11- More is murkier: (a) more decimal places and (b) more dimensions (show fewer decimal places unless really, absolutely, and unequivocally necessary, and reduce the number of dimensions to those necessary, more dimensions = more confusing)
Rule 12- If it has been done well in the past, think of another way to do it (NO, do not reinvent the wheel!)

frequency distributions: bar graph or histogram
-histogram - the area of the bar (width) shows how frequent a range of something is (must choose number of bins and bin widths
-MUST start at zero for the baseline, otherwise can be misleading in showing the difference

Rule 9- Austria first (do not always alphabetize data entries)
Rule 10- Label (a) illegibly, (b) incompletely, (c) incorrectly, and (d) ambiguously
Rule 11- More is murkier: (a) more decimal places and (b) more dimensions (show fewer decimal places unless really, absolutely, and unequivocally necessary, and reduce the number of dimensions to those necessary, more dimensions = more confusing)
Rule 12- If it has been done well in the past, think of another way to do it (NO, do not reinvent the wheel!)

frequency distributions: bar graph or histogram
-histogram - the area of the bar (width) shows how frequent a range of something is (must choose number of bins and bin widths

to find patch occupancy and level of adaptation

generally believed: as gene flow increases, local adaptation decreases, unless pop is a sink in which case it is similar to genetic rescue where the gene flow saves it from going extinct
(or in host pathogen systems especially be beneficial input)

when there is constant evolution, e.g. coevolving spa, local adaptation never stops b/c it is a moving target.  SAME is true in metapops for recolonizations in heterogeneous env.s b/c colonists are not adapted

but the scale of adaptation in metapops can he higher than just patch level

** when maladaptation is not costly, there results "network adaptation" where it is kind of like having a generalist species adapted to neither habitat

with high cost of maladaptation, specialization to the most common habitat type occurs


*** higher migration leads to network adaptation




Sylvain,

{\&}gt; A few points came up from this discussion:
{\&}gt; - Is equation (7) derived from a specific life cycle, or just assumed so that, for example, mean fitness affects the production of migrants? I guess what is at stake is the details of the underlying within patch dynamics and how it affects emigration and immigration.
{\&}gt;
There is no underlying within-population model to justify this assumption, this is just an assumption. I think that this is ok for many organisms (e.g. insects), but I can see that in some others (e.g. vertebrates) low fitness might actually induce emigration.

{\&}gt; - In appendix A we don't understand the sentence just after equation A1. Why do you say that you need sexual reproduction to see an effect of migration?
{\&}gt;
In a clonal model, poorly adapted immigrants do badly in competition with well-adapted residents and hence migration and gene flow doesn't have a big influence on local adaptation. With sexual reproduction, poorly adapted immigrants have a bigger influence on local adaptation by reproducing with the residents and thereby lowering their fitness.

{\&}gt; - Also, for the IBM, could you precise what is the order of events in your simulations? This could change the type of selection (soft versus hard selection) and may affect a lot the evolutionary outcome.
{\&}gt;
the order is: reproduction, density dependence, and dispersal, allowing just one move per individual per generation.

Do you think there is a disconnect in statistics across fields (ecology/evolution vs medical vs psychology {\ldots})?

Could it be laziness?  (it is simple to look at a p and say y/n, but to interpret the biology and look at effect sizes, one has to think)  Are reviewers lazy or just indifferent?

Or do people not understand the difference between: What we want to know is "Given these data, what is the prob- ability that Ho is true?" But as most of us know, what it tells us is "Given that Ho is true, what is the probability of these (or more extreme) data?"

He claims we might be trying to hard to find answers where there are none?


(statistical commandments quote "thou shalt not presume statistical significance to be of scientific importance"

I still don't think I understand his "member of Congress" example, and disagree with how he describes this

Agree disagree with his statement that the null is universally taken to be zero (i.e. not "the proportion of males in this population is .75")

Why do you think we initially created the p-value, out of lack of understanding or something else? (i.e. were we wrong in way back when implementing p{\&}lt;0.05)

Agree/disagree: "All psychologists know that statistically significant does not mean plain-English sig- nificant, but if one reads the literature, one often discovers that a finding reported in the Results section studded with asterisks implicitly becomes in the Discussion sec- tion highly significant or very highly significant, impor- tant, big!"

He states "As I have noted, we have a body of statistical techniques, that, used intelligently, can facilitate our efforts. But given the problems of statistical induction, we must finally rely, as have the older sciences, on replication."  So perhaps it is just laziness or stupidity/poor education that we find these issues today?}

high cost (reduced power) of controlling type I error for multiple tests

easier to interpret and more powerful

with more than one test there is always a chance (alpha) of a significant result then there really is no effect
as {\#} tests increases, the number of false conclusions (type 1 errors) increases
usu. corrected with bonferroni, where p is adjusted, so that the chance of type 1 error is decreased (called familywise error rate, FWER)
BUT this directly costs more type 2 errors (falsely accept null), makes bonferroni undesirable b/c can only detect v. strong effects
some solutions: step-down/sequential bonferroni, performs tests in order of increasing p, or step-up which goes through decreasing p (gives you more gains in power) 

rather should control proportion of significant results that are in fact type 1 errors (false discoveries)
when all null hypotheses are true, FWER = FDR

The effect of patch characteristics (size, vegetation cover, connectivity, stability and density of favourable habitat), long-term population size and APA on population genetic structure was investigated using the Bayesian method GESTE 2.0 (Foll {\&}amp; Gaggiotti 2006). This method estimates the genetic differentiation between each local population and the overall metapopulation (hereafter, site-specific FST) and relates it to environmental factors using a generalized linear model. We used 10 pilot runs of 5000 iterations to obtain proposal distributions. Posterior probabilities were obtained by a MCMC with 5 · 104 burn-in iterations, a thinning interval of 20 and a sam- ple size of 10 000.}

annote = {rare, locally favored allele spreads when rare if and only if the absolute fitness of the heterozygote at equal. pop size exceeds 1
when immigration is higher though, hamper's this alleles spread and prevents local adaptation (or at least limits it)
the condition for spread of a rare allele is also the necessary and sufficient condition for niche evolution in a black-hole sink
Immigration will be a more important source of new A1 alleles in the island population when hs is small than when hs is large.
density dependence causes local fitnesses in the sink to depend on the immigration rate

We have assumed in much of the text that absolute fitnesses show negative density dependence, so that dWij􏱌dN{\&}lt;0. If there is a range of N for which dWij 􏱌dN{\&}gt;0 ("Allee effects'') then increasing immigration enhances local fitnesses and may thereby facilitate the evolution of local adaptation.}

accounting for both sides of the road, and in 2 directions, this indicates that overall about 1.86 in 100 plants contribute to an effective colonization event outside the segment itself

overall colonization rate of 0.01 is remarkably similar to that observed in the field for this study

annote = {In the short term, migration can change allele frequen- cies quite quickly. Given that the temporal methods estimate Ne by measuring the pace at which allele fre- quencies change, migration causes a population to be- have as if strong drift was changing allele frequencies very rapidly, resulting in an estimate of Ne that is too low. In the longer term, the problem is reversed. Constant migration and drift would cause the populations to ap- proach an equilibrium level of genetic differentiation and the rate of change of allele frequencies in a deme to slow down to approach that predicted by the effective size of the whole metapopulation. Thus the effective population size of the deme would be substantially over- estimated in the long term.

p.283: From a genetic point of view, forest trees show,whatever their life-history traits, high levels of within-population diversity and low levels of among-populationdifferentiation compared to herbaceous plants (Hamricket al, 1992; Hamrick and Godt, 1996). This may appearsurprising because colonisation frequently leads to anexcess of differentiation among populations, whencompared with the equilibrium situation (Austerlitzet al, 1997; Le Corre and Kremer, 1998), as a consequenceof successive founder effects that accompany thecreation of new populations, each genetically differen-tiated from the previous populations. However, Auster-litz et al (2000) have shown that the long lifespan of trees,and more importantly, their long juvenile phase, drama-tically reduce the founder effects observed duringcolonisation by allowing more migrants to arrive, andeventually participate in reproduction when it takesplace. }

annote = {p.6: if the environment changes through time, it is possible that greater rates of migration will enhance local adaptation
!!! p.10: our study assumed symmetric migration, but relaxing this assumption could have interesting consequences !!!
gene swamping only prevents local adaptation with small populations or pops where there is very high migration
not sure I understand this: p.9: although drift causes population mean phenotypes to deviate from their local optima, this does not affect the local adaptation on average (it only affects mean fitness through the spatial load)
mean fitness if a function of: environmental load + local variance load + spatial variance load + adaptation to the environment
This result reveals that local adaptation has the appealing property of directly quantifying the extent to which population mean phenotypes match local environmental conditions
for polygenic traits under the same level of selection; each locus will have that much weaker seln}

In particular, the effects of subdivision on the maintenance of genetic variation are important both for understanding how natural populations evolve (WRIGHT1931, 1939; PROVINE1986
The loss of neutral variability, while in itself somewhat interesting, is often used as a barometer for all of the genetic variation of a species, a metric often applied in conservation biology (LANDE and BARROWCLOUGH 1987
While the effective size does not predict all of the behavior of the fixation of favorable alleles in subdivided populations, it does serve as a good first approximation (BAR- TON 1993;CABALLERO 1994). Furthermore, the effective size tells us about the limits to natural selection, as alleles whose advantage is such that NJ {\&}lt; 1 are very likely to be lost due to drift (MARUYAMA and KIMURA 1980), and deleterious alleles are more likely to be fixed in smaller populations (KONDRASHO19V95; LYNCeHt al. 1995).
Ne will always go up as census size goes up, so important to understand if you are sampling a panmictic pop or not

annote = {metapop model, patches of diff quality

to find patch occupancy and level of adaptation

generally believed: as gene flow increases, local adaptation decreases, unless pop is a sink in which case it is similar to genetic rescue where the gene flow saves it from going extinct
(or in host pathogen systems especially be beneficial input)

when there is constant evolution, e.g. coevolving spa, local adaptation never stops b/c it is a moving target.  SAME is true in metapops for recolonizations in heterogeneous env.s b/c colonists are not adapted

but the scale of adaptation in metapops can he higher than just patch level

** when maladaptation is not costly, there results "network adaptation" where it is kind of like having a generalist species adapted to neither habitat

with high cost of maladaptation, specialization to the most common habitat type occurs


*** higher migration leads to network adaptation




Sylvain,

{\&}gt; A few points came up from this discussion:
{\&}gt; - Is equation (7) derived from a specific life cycle, or just assumed so that, for example, mean fitness affects the production of migrants? I guess what is at stake is the details of the underlying within patch dynamics and how it affects emigration and immigration.
{\&}gt;
There is no underlying within-population model to justify this assumption, this is just an assumption. I think that this is ok for many organisms (e.g. insects), but I can see that in some others (e.g. vertebrates) low fitness might actually induce emigration.

{\&}gt; - In appendix A we don't understand the sentence just after equation A1. Why do you say that you need sexual reproduction to see an effect of migration?
{\&}gt;
In a clonal model, poorly adapted immigrants do badly in competition with well-adapted residents and hence migration and gene flow doesn't have a big influence on local adaptation. With sexual reproduction, poorly adapted immigrants have a bigger influence on local adaptation by reproducing with the residents and thereby lowering their fitness.

{\&}gt; - Also, for the IBM, could you precise what is the order of events in your simulations? This could change the type of selection (soft versus hard selection) and may affect a lot the evolutionary outcome.
{\&}gt;
the order is: reproduction, density dependence, and dispersal, allowing just one move per individual per generation.

because the model with all differences was not significantly different than that within 3km, it is suggested that dispersal events over 3km are relatively unimportant in the metapop

disease transmission may be a function of fraction of diseased individuals in a population rather than absolute number

host colonization alpha = 0.0025 and theta = 0.49, highly signify. correspondence between observed and predicted values (fig 2)

near middle of paper: a fraction 0.00372 can be detected as colonists away from that plant in one linear direction on one side of the road

accounting for both sides of the road, and in 2 directions, this indicates that overall about 1.86 in 100 plants contribute to an effective colonization event outside the segment itself

overall colonization rate of 0.01 is remarkably similar to that observed in the field for this study
