\section{Summary}

how does the genetic architecture of quantitative traits change as a result of demography and selection during the maize domestication bottleneck and the further bottleneck from C America to S America for some maize pops
	
if we compare maize and teosinte (which are locally adapted in their respective pops), do we see evidence of:
	many genes of small effect, few genes of large effect underlying important traits?
	do these differences match our predictions based on the effects their diff. demographic histories should have had?
	
could inform on maintaining diversity in crops for the future in ways that may have much larger long term impacts in the maintenance of diversity as well as fitness/adaptation in the face of climate change

\section*{Intro}
	
genetic architecture underlying traits affects how easy/hard and quick/slow local adaptation can occur. important for breeding, conservation, predicting response to climate change, etc.
useful info for crops/domesticated species (and also things like disease in humans?)
	
selection interacts with demography. $N_es>1$ for selection to win.
as demography changes, $N_es$ changes.
demography also can lead to purging (recessives become homozygous and removed in smaller pops), but also increase in deleterious alleles (surfing phenomenon)
mutations that affect a trait related to fitness will then be impacted by demography x selection interaction.
in annual plants, nearly ALL traits related to fitness
we thus predict that genetic architecture (number and size of mutations) should be impacted by demographic change.
this is not understood well in any system. controversial in humans (lohmueller vs. pritchard etc.). in plants, summaries are on gross overall $N_e$ (small vs. big) and ignore recent demographic change.

\section*{Proposed Research}
	
in the maize/teosinte system, there is a solid understanding of demographic history, from
domestication $\approx$9000 years ago in SW Mexico.
bottleneck, recent expansion. 
cite Beissinger in prep (github repo) and briefly explain findings (bneck to 5\% 9K years ago, followed by humongous growth to at least 300K but maybe as much as 1E9
	
%using genomic data from both maize and teosinte across their species' ranges, we can compare
%	classes of functional diversity, using e.g. GERP scores, across pops of different demographic history
%	look at the distribution of these as well as in beneficial traits if possible
%can compare these results to simulations parameterized to match known demog. of teosinte/maize

also have great data on quant traits. will need to explain rare alleles pops and experiment some.

\subsection{Obj 1 - Estimate the DFE}
	from polymorphism/divergence data. use HapMap2 or current teosinte genomes (I think I'd vote for latter)
	\url{http://goo.gl/CLmsmX} and \url{http://www.genetics.org/content/177/4/2251.short})
	can either use estimated demographic model or use noncoding sites to normalize SFS
	
	can compare to e.g. GERP distribution perhaps as validation?
		
	\kjg{this gets at magnitude of effect, but also want to get at how many loci may be contributing to any given trait?}
    \jri{nope. we just need DFE. see obj 2}

	
\subsection{Obj 2 - Simulate scenarios of different traits.}
	
	simulate using estimated demography and DFE.
	simulate traits w/ varying correlation with fitness
	new mutation effects on fitness determined by DFE, effect on trait by correlation between trait and fitness
	
	evaluate:
		how many loci contribute to important traits?
		how strong are these effects?
		how do details of demography impact outcome?
		test against theory e.g \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3028}
	
	(could also do some broader simulated examples just to stand alone and see if other various outcomes may occur - just don't plan on comparing these to any real data)\jri{yes, once we can show we can recapitulate real data, i think this is useful}

\subsection{Obj 3 - compare simulation results to modern maize genomes, known to have undergone the same demographies simulated in objective 2}%
	compare to GWAS for maize/teo. do we recapitulate oversvations? if not, why? 
	are there differences between central and southern American pops? \jri{we have no GWAS data for S.Amer. pops, but do have genomes and GERP. we could get freq. etc. of del. mutations from sims and compare to GERP}

Other larger picture impacts/intellectual merit?

it is thought, and shown in some human pops, that demog. history such as expansion leads to an increase in delet alleles, and of larger effects - b/c of continued inferred expansions and bottlenecks. 
is there any evidence of this in maize?
