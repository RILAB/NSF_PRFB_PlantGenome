%	IV.	Synergistic Activities
%		-----------------------------------

%	*	List up to five examples that demonstrate the broader impact of the professional 
%		and scholarly activities that focuses on the integration and knowledge transfer as 
%		well as its creation.
%	*	Examples could
%		include, among others: innovations in teaching and training (e.g., development
%		of curricular materials and pedagogical methods); contributions to the science
%		of learning; development and/or refinement of research tools; computation
%		methodologies, and algorithms for problem-solving; development of databases
%		to support research and education; broadening the participation of groups
%		under-represented in science, mathematics, engineering and technology; and
%		service to the scientific and engineering community outside of the
%		immediate organization.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Working Groups:} Participated in the Reproducible Science Hackathon at \href{http://www.nescent.org/}{NESCent} in December 2014 which was a 21-member working group aimed at developing a curriculum and workflow for teaching reproducible science to researchers of any background. Participated in the SimBank \href{http://www.nescent.org/}{NESCent} Catalysis Meeting in November 2014which was a 25-member working group aiming to create a collection of openly available simulation results to facilitate testing of statistical population genetic and phylogeographic methods.

\item \textbf{Teaching:} Teaching assistant for Fundamentals of Evolutionary Biology (BIOL 336) in the fall of 2012 and spring of 2013 where I taught three sections of 45 students each per term and lead discussion-based tutorials covering topics of natural selection, population genetics, quantitative genetics, systematics, and classical and molecular approaches to the study of evolution. Teaching assistant for Fundamentals of Biostatistics (BIOL 300) in the fall of 2013, 2014, and 2015. Taught two sections of 70 students total in 2013, and in 2014 and 2015 served as the lab coordinator for 254 and 276 students enrolled in the course, respectively, while teaching one section of 36 and 35 students respectively on topics of statistical procedures for biological research, estimation, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, analysis of variance and regression, and use of computers for statistical analysis.

\item \textbf{Service:} Served as a Graduate Student Council Member for the \href {http://www.amnat.org/home.html}{American Society of Naturalists} from 2013 to 2016 and was chair of the committee from 2015-2016. Served as the graduate student representative on the 2014 evolutionary biology CRC2 job search for the Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia. From 2014-2016, organized the Biodiversity Research Centre's weekly \href{http://www.biodiversity.ubc.ca/edg/}{evolution discussion group}, bringing students, post-docs, and faculty together from the departments of Zoology, Botany, Forestry, and Fisheries to discuss current papers in evolutionary biology.

\item \textbf{Outreach:}  Volunteer mist-netting and bird banding with local Vancouver non-profit organization \href {http://www.wildresearch.ca/IonaIsland.html}{Wild Research} from 2013 to 2015 where I participated in winter, spring migration, and fall migration bird monitoring at Iona Island Bird Observatory, taught proper bird handling, aging, data collection, and mist net extraction techniques to new volunteers, and assisted in teaching other volunteers and public visitors to the station about the species conservation and monitoring, and the general tasks of running a banding station.
